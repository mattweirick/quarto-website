Building on the scholarship and discussions around vocational awe, this panel will be equal parts research and advocacy.

But it is often difficult for instructors to anticipate the writing and information literacy skills their assignments require. To address this, UCLA librarians have partnered with writing faculty to create a course planner to help WAC instructors predict an assignment’s composition and research demands, and devise student-centered activities to address them. This session describes the collaboration that led to the planner and workshops conducted for WAC faculty and TAs, and gives participants opportunities to share similar ideas that are working on their campuses.\n          \n        \n      \n      \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                            writing and research\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                            information literacy\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                            2021\n                        \n                    \n            \n            \n      \n      \n      \n    \n  \n    \n      Conflicting interests and begrudging partnerships: Turning critical pedagogy on human resources\n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n        \n          2020.

For full chapter drafts, citations will be formatted in the Chicago Manual of Style endnotes and bibliography format. Chicago Manual of Style provides a quick guide with sample citations.\nFinal chapter submissions will include brief author biographies (under 150 words each).\nChapters can include appendices, illustrations, figures, etc. and these are encouraged where materials might be adaptable or reusable for others attempting to create similar initiatives. See more clarification from ACRL Press below for incorporating this content into your drafts: &gt;Charts, graphs, bulleted lists, photos, and other illustrations or enhancements of your content are welcomed and encouraged! Charts and graphs can be created directly in the Word document, or as separate Excel or other files such as Adobe Illustrator, as long as their placement is labelled within the manuscript and the separate file is named accordingly. For instance, if it’s the third figure in [your] chapter, place [[LAST NAME FIGURE 3 HERE]] where you’d like it to appear in the manuscript, and name the separate file LAST NAME FIGURE 3. For photos, please keep them separate from the manuscript, label their placement in the manuscript, and name the file according to the system above (note: authors are responsible for securing permissions for any figure or image they wish published that they did not create themselves or that is not in the public domain).\n\nFinal chapter manuscripts will be professionally designed, so authors shouldn’t worry too much about the appearance of the Word docs—it will change through the production process. Please use a standard font at 11 or 12 points, double spaced, and make sure the headers are consistently formatted so that our designer knows how to style them. Final chapter submissions will be copyedited for grammar, style, etc., and you will review the redline edit before we move into design. (ACRL Press)"

Job control includes control over tasks, scheduling, work pacing, physical environment, decision-making, interaction, and mobility. A web survey was administered to academic librarians with instruction responsibilities. The survey included a previously developed scale for measuring job control and several key demographic and job characteristic questions that were hypothesized to impact job control. 307 academic instruction librarians completed the job control scale. Analyzing each item in the job control scale, teaching workload, status, income, years at institution and in libraries, teacher training, union representation, and tenure status have statistically significant effects on responses to at least one question in the scale. Through analysis of the average response among academic instruction librarians in the sample, control over decision-making, including allocation of resources and salaries, and interactions appear to be two places where managers and library leaders may focus improvements. Control over the amount of money academic instruction librarians earn and over how their work is evaluated were the lowest across the 22 items in the job control scale. As library leaders and managers consider the practical implications of job control research on their work, earnings, evaluation processes, and interactions or interruptions may be key areas to enact changes or provide further transparency and shared decision-making.\n          \n        \n      \n      \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                            Burnout\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                            Job Control\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                            Academic Instruction Librarians\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                            2024\n                        \n                    \n            \n            \n      \n      \n      \n    \n  \n    \n      The limits of inclusion in open access: Accessible access, universal design, and open educational resources\n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n        \n          2023.

Without mitigating the positive outcomes of OER—including reduced textbook costs, readily available knowledge platforms, and open research—we problematize the commonly held assumption that open resources are necessarily more accessible and inherently good.Description of Program: Drawing on writing from antiracist, feminist disability researchers and advocates, we critically examine the UCLA Library online open educational initiative known as Writing Instruction + Research Education (WI+RE). In doing so, we (1) demonstrate how open access (OA) is often framed as an end, when in fact it is just the beginning; (2) encourage readers to resist evangelizing the OA movement such that it is beyond critique; and (3) advocate for the centering of disability justice within and beyond our OA efforts.Next Steps: We discuss both general and specific approaches for centering accessibility in creative processes, advocate for expanded definitions of OERs (beyond simply being “free”), and caution against evangelizing OERs without acknowledging the structural factors that contribute to inaccessibility. We outline four strategies and recommendations for other practitioners, educators, and designers seeking to build accessibility and dis-ability justice into OER design and OA initiatives more broadly. We approach OER both practically and theoretically to present an argument and path forward for designing more accessible resources and expanding OA through accessible access and universal design.\n          \n        \n      \n      \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                            Open Access\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                            Open Educational Resources\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                            2023\n                        \n                    \n            \n            \n      \n      \n      \n    \n  \n    \n      Job control and its impacts on burnout in academic instruction librarians\n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n        \n          2023.

This study uses the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI) and Job Control Inventory to show how job control impacts burnout. Using the CBI, academic instruction librarians, on average, have high work-related burnout and even higher personal burnout compared to other jobs. However, librarians have low client-related burnout, similar to other “caring” or “helping” professions. The findings point to key factors that impact job control and burnout to help consider ways of mitigating burnout and increasing job control.\n          \n        \n      \n      \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                            Burnout\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                            Job Control\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                            Academic Instruction Librarians\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                            2023\n                        \n                    \n            \n            \n      \n      \n      \n    \n  \n    \n      Collaborative research services: A peer-led cohort approach\n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n        \n          2023.

Multiple locations were staffed by Library Student Research Assistants (LSRAs) and each location was supervised independently. While efforts to increase collaboration had been underway, much of the work and services remained siloed and often duplicated training and service hours.Design/methodology/approachWith the onset of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), UCLA Library rapidly transitioned from entirely in-person to entirely online services. With multiple service points pivoting, UCLA was redundant to have multiple online desks providing Zoom appointments and that quickly became apparent. Moreover, transitioning in-person student work to remote work was paramount to providing both normal services to users and allowing LSRAs to keep jobs during a time of uncertainty and insecurity.FindingsWhile the authors' original consolidation of services and implementation of shared supervision was a result of the pandemic and primarily involved online services, the authors have maintained this shared approach and collaborative vision in returning to in-person services. For the past year, the authors have offered shared in-person (at two library locations) and online services. As subject-specific library locations begin to reopen their desks, the authors continue to identify ways to leverage shared supervision and a robust referral model for those on-site services while negotiating student staffing and the need for both general and subject-specific services.Originality/valueThe authors present a novel approach to peer-to-peer teaching and learning and research services and shared student worker supervision with services coordinated across multiple locations and disciplines within a large academic library serving a large student population.\n          \n        \n      \n      \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                            Research Services\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                            Management\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                            Student Workers\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                            2023\n                        \n                    \n            \n            \n      \n      \n      \n    \n  \n    \n      The Community Workshop Series: A case study for community-engaged learning in LIS\n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n        \n          2021.

Both authors have served as coordinators of the program as library science graduate students at the UNC School of Information and Library Science. We situate this program within existing literature on digital and information literacy, community engagement, and the graduate student experience to show the utility of this program and similar programs for training graduate students, enhancing the graduate student experience, supporting the needs of community members, and bolstering the capacities of public libraries. The authors provide an overview of the program and encourage others to start similar programs. To this end, the authors present a case study of the CWS, including discussion of creating the program and keeping things going, and provide a how-to guide for creating your own. The authors identify four recommendations for creating a similar program to clearly delineate takeaways that might inform readers’ attempts to create similar programs, and they provide additional materials and documentation in appendices to support the creation of new community-engaged programs in LIS.\n          \n        \n      \n      \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                            Community Workshop Series\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                            LIS Education\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                            Community-engaged Learning\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                            2021\n                        \n                    \n            \n            \n      \n      \n      \n    \n  \n    \n      Collaborative digital projects in the undergraduate humanities classroom: Case studies with TimelineJS\n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n        \n          2021.

The case studies offer a framework for assignment scaffolding (including iteration and reflection), FERPA rights management, and describe models of faculty-librarian collaboration in assignment design and implementation. These assignments provide students an introduction to basic metadata and HTML markup skills and empower them to explore the historical contexts of primary sources by visualizing the chronology of historical periods.\n          \n        \n      \n      \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                            TimelineJS\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                            Critical Digital Pedagogy\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                            2021\n                        \n                    \n            \n            \n      \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\nNo matching items"

The program is intended to support writing and research skills development for BIPOC, LGBTQIA, and disabled student researchers in-terested in pursuing careers in academia. Our chapter details the history of the program, elaborates on the extensive campus partnerships involved in its success, and provides reflections and best practices around program coordination, cultur-ally responsive pedagogy, student experience outside the classroom, and remote instruction to help others establish similar programs at their institutions. In par-ticular, we explore the necessary structures to create a sustainable and flexible program that has continued successfully for several years while also accounting for changing student needs, changes in personnel, historical events like protests and the pandemic, and a shift from offering the program in-person to online.\n          \n        \n      \n      \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                            Library Instruction\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                            Undergradaute Research\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                            Writing & Reseearch\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                            2023\n                        \n                    \n            \n            \n      \n      \n      \n    \n  \n    \n      What’s in a workload?

This is particularly troubling for service professions and feminized fields such as librarianship where invisible labor in the form of emotional labor is often an expected aspect of the job. To better consider affective and emotional labor, we explore these concepts and their application in library literature, and we discuss the ways that burnout is gendered and raced. We consider existing literature on burnout in academic libraries, assessment of burnout among academic librarians, and proposed solutions for burnout. We present several recommendations for approaching affect, burnout, and complicating capacity in order to more holistically understand and combat burnout.\n          \n        \n      \n      \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                            Burnout\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                            Workload\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                            2022\n                        \n                    \n            \n            \n      \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\nNo matching items"

Remote teaching has been extended through all subsequent teaching periods through summer 2021. Similarly, remote work has remained a predominant work situation for the majority of UCLA Library staff, although some staff have returned to in-person work to support services that required on-site activity. A wider return to work will begin in July 2021.

The present paper argues for the integration of information literacy skills and instruction with a critical understanding of personal health data to provide useful skills for managing the massive amounts of personal health data that users are generating. My goal is to argue for an expansion of data information literacy to provide the necessary skills for users and researchers to critically assess their relationship to personal health data, understanding the concurrent modes of doing and undergoing surveillance.\n          \n        \n      \n      \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                            Information Literacy\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                            2018\n                        \n                    \n            \n            \n      \n      \n      \n    \n  \n    \n      ‘All human beings, as we meet them, are commingled out of good and evil’: Connections between person and place in Wuthering Heights\n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n        \n          2016.
