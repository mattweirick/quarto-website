As far as quantitative analysis of burnout is concerned, the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) has been a primary tool for measuring burnout among human services workers. However, the tool is proprietary and can be cost-prohibitive for large samples or small/non-existent budgets. As we consider the measurement of burnout as a field, open tools are better aligned with the values of librarianship, and free tools are better aligned with the resources available for conducting research or internal assessments. The Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI) is a non-commercial, free, and easy-to-administer tool for measuring burnout across three dimensions: personal, work-related, and client-related. The CBI presents a cost-effective alternative to the MBI which may be particularly enticing for academic library leaders and researchers. This study assesses the psychometric properties, including factor structure and scale reliability, to contribute to demonstrating construct validity of the CBI among academic librarians in the United Studies using a probability sample stratified by institutional Carnegie classifications and geographic region.Confirmatory Factory Analysis (CFA) is used the examine the factor structure and model fit of five models for the CBI: a correlated three factors model, a correlated two factors model (using work-related and client-related burnout), and three single factor models for each of the three independent subscales (personal, work-related, and client-related burnout). The factorial validity and model fit for the five models demonstrated in the study are reasonable, suggesting that the items in the three scales are successfully measuring the latent constructs (personal burnout, work-related burnout, and client-related burnout), which contributes to construct validity. The expected relationship between the observed variables (the items in the measurement model) and the latent constructs is supported by the CFA analyses. While other examinations of validity, including other aspects of construct validity, should also be examined, the findings support the use of the CBI for measurement of burnout among academic librarians.\n          \n        \n      \n      \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                            Burnout\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                            Librarian Worklife\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                            2024\n                        \n                    \n            \n            \n      \n      \n      \n    \n  \n    \n      Academic instruction librarians' feelings of job control: Quantitative analysis of responses to a job control inventory\n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n        \n          2024.

Job control includes control over tasks, scheduling, work pacing, physical environment, decision-making, interaction, and mobility. A web survey was administered to academic librarians with instruction responsibilities. The survey included a previously developed scale for measuring job control and several key demographic and job characteristic questions that were hypothesized to impact job control. 307 academic instruction librarians completed the job control scale. Analyzing each item in the job control scale, teaching workload, status, income, years at institution and in libraries, teacher training, union representation, and tenure status have statistically significant effects on responses to at least one question in the scale. Through analysis of the average response among academic instruction librarians in the sample, control over decision-making, including allocation of resources and salaries, and interactions appear to be two places where managers and library leaders may focus improvements. Control over the amount of money academic instruction librarians earn and over how their work is evaluated were the lowest across the 22 items in the job control scale. As library leaders and managers consider the practical implications of job control research on their work, earnings, evaluation processes, and interactions or interruptions may be key areas to enact changes or provide further transparency and shared decision-making.\n          \n        \n      \n      \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                            Job Control\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                            Academic Instruction Librarians\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                            Librarian Worklife\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                            2024\n                        \n                    \n            \n            \n      \n      \n      \n    \n  \n    \n      The limits of inclusion in open access: Accessible access, universal design, and open educational resources\n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n        \n          2023.

Without mitigating the positive outcomes of OER—including reduced textbook costs, readily available knowledge platforms, and open research—we problematize the commonly held assumption that open resources are necessarily more accessible and inherently good.Description of Program: Drawing on writing from antiracist, feminist disability researchers and advocates, we critically examine the UCLA Library online open educational initiative known as Writing Instruction + Research Education (WI+RE). In doing so, we (1) demonstrate how open access (OA) is often framed as an end, when in fact it is just the beginning; (2) encourage readers to resist evangelizing the OA movement such that it is beyond critique; and (3) advocate for the centering of disability justice within and beyond our OA efforts.Next Steps: We discuss both general and specific approaches for centering accessibility in creative processes, advocate for expanded definitions of OERs (beyond simply being “free”), and caution against evangelizing OERs without acknowledging the structural factors that contribute to inaccessibility. We outline four strategies and recommendations for other practitioners, educators, and designers seeking to build accessibility and dis-ability justice into OER design and OA initiatives more broadly. We approach OER both practically and theoretically to present an argument and path forward for designing more accessible resources and expanding OA through accessible access and universal design.\n          \n        \n      \n      \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                            Open Access\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                            Open Educational Resources\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                            2023\n                        \n                    \n            \n            \n      \n      \n      \n    \n  \n    \n      Job control and its impacts on burnout in academic instruction librarians\n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n        \n          2023.

This study uses the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI) and Job Control Inventory to show how job control impacts burnout. Using the CBI, academic instruction librarians, on average, have high work-related burnout and even higher personal burnout compared to other jobs. However, librarians have low client-related burnout, similar to other “caring” or “helping” professions. The findings point to key factors that impact job control and burnout to help consider ways of mitigating burnout and increasing job control.\n          \n        \n      \n      \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                            Burnout\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                            Job Control\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                            Academic Instruction Librarians\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                            Librarian Worklife\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                            2023\n                        \n                    \n            \n            \n      \n      \n      \n    \n  \n    \n      Collaborative research services: A peer-led cohort approach\n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n        \n          2023.

Multiple locations were staffed by Library Student Research Assistants (LSRAs) and each location was supervised independently. While efforts to increase collaboration had been underway, much of the work and services remained siloed and often duplicated training and service hours.Design/methodology/approachWith the onset of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), UCLA Library rapidly transitioned from entirely in-person to entirely online services. With multiple service points pivoting, UCLA was redundant to have multiple online desks providing Zoom appointments and that quickly became apparent. Moreover, transitioning in-person student work to remote work was paramount to providing both normal services to users and allowing LSRAs to keep jobs during a time of uncertainty and insecurity.FindingsWhile the authors' original consolidation of services and implementation of shared supervision was a result of the pandemic and primarily involved online services, the authors have maintained this shared approach and collaborative vision in returning to in-person services. For the past year, the authors have offered shared in-person (at two library locations) and online services. As subject-specific library locations begin to reopen their desks, the authors continue to identify ways to leverage shared supervision and a robust referral model for those on-site services while negotiating student staffing and the need for both general and subject-specific services.Originality/valueThe authors present a novel approach to peer-to-peer teaching and learning and research services and shared student worker supervision with services coordinated across multiple locations and disciplines within a large academic library serving a large student population.\n          \n        \n      \n      \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                            Research Services\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                            Management\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                            Student Workers\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                            2023\n                        \n                    \n            \n            \n      \n      \n      \n    \n  \n    \n      The Community Workshop Series: A case study for community-engaged learning in LIS\n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n        \n          2021.

The program is intended to support writing and research skills development for BIPOC, LGBTQIA, and disabled student researchers in-terested in pursuing careers in academia. Our chapter details the history of the program, elaborates on the extensive campus partnerships involved in its success, and provides reflections and best practices around program coordination, cultur-ally responsive pedagogy, student experience outside the classroom, and remote instruction to help others establish similar programs at their institutions. In par-ticular, we explore the necessary structures to create a sustainable and flexible program that has continued successfully for several years while also accounting for changing student needs, changes in personnel, historical events like protests and the pandemic, and a shift from offering the program in-person to online.\n          \n        \n      \n      \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                            Library Instruction\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                            Undergradaute Research\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                            Writing & Reseearch\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                            2023\n                        \n                    \n            \n            \n      \n      \n      \n    \n  \n    \n      What’s in a workload?

This is particularly troubling for service professions and feminized fields such as librarianship where invisible labor in the form of emotional labor is often an expected aspect of the job. To better consider affective and emotional labor, we explore these concepts and their application in library literature, and we discuss the ways that burnout is gendered and raced. We consider existing literature on burnout in academic libraries, assessment of burnout among academic librarians, and proposed solutions for burnout. We present several recommendations for approaching affect, burnout, and complicating capacity in order to more holistically understand and combat burnout.\n          \n        \n      \n      \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                            Burnout\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                            Workload\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                            Librarian Worklife\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                            2022\n                        \n                    \n            \n            \n      \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\nNo matching items"

Remote teaching has been extended through all subsequent teaching periods through summer 2021. Similarly, remote work has remained a predominant work situation for the majority of UCLA Library staff, although some staff have returned to in-person work to support services that required on-site activity. A wider return to work will begin in July 2021.

    "section": "Introduction",
    "text": "Introduction\nLibrarians have been grappling with the issue of burnout for decades, at least, with many acknowledging its prevalence in the profession. In recent years, additional empirical evidence, both quantitative and qualitative, has been published. Two specific instances have applied quantitative inventories to measure burnout among academic librarians. Applying the Areas of Worklife Survey and Maslach Burnout Inventory, Nardine (2019) found “that lack of personal agency is the primary contributor to a sense of burnout” (p. 508). Additionally, employing the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory, Wood et al. (2020) found that librarian perceptions of burnout are quite high in comparison to other occupations, including nurses, hospital doctors, and social workers. Burnout is clearly a central concern for the profession that has received considerable attention in scholarship and other discussions, and agency or job control may be a large contributor.\nBurnout has been identified as a predictor of various negative consequences for employee health and wellbeing and for organizational success. These include physical consequences (cardiovascular diseases, pain, and impaired immune function), psychological consequences (depression and insomnia), and occupational consequences (absenteeism, poor performance, and job dissatisfaction). Given the negative impacts of burnout on employees and organizations, managers and administrators should consider preventative measures to mitigate burnout. Job control may be one area worth focusing mitigation measures.\nLibrarians may lack job control generally and when providing library instruction specifically. There is no current data about job control among librarians, though job control does appear to be tied to burnout. However, little scholarly research considers librarian agency or begins to understand the factors that contribute to agency or feelings of agency for librarians at work. In order to improve job control and mitigate burnout in the workplace, we first need to understand how job control is experienced and what factors impact that experience.\nGiven the relationship between job control and burnout and the negative impacts of burnout, it stands to reason that managers and administrators should work with employees to increase their job control as a means of mitigating burnout (Salvagioni et al., 2017). However, further research on job control and burnout among librarians is needed.\nThis study seeks to address this research problem and fill the gap identified in the literature around librarian perceptions of job control generally and regarding instruction specifically. The study considers the following research questions:\n\nFor academic instruction librarians, how does job control impact burnout?\nWhat factors contribute to job control and burnout for academic instruction librarians? To what extent do these factors contribute to job control?\n\nThis study uses the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI) and Job Control Inventory to show how job control impacts burnout. Using the CBI, academic instruction librarians, on average, have drastically high work-related burnout and even higher personal burnout compared to other jobs. However, librarians have drastically low client-related burnout, similar to other “caring” or “helping” professions. I argue that this difference is related to vocational awe and that person-centered management is necessary to approach employees holistically to mitigate personal and work-related burnout, which are statistically correlated. Additionally, the findings point to key factors that impact job control and burnout to help consider ways of mitigating burnout and increasing job control."

    "section": "Literature Review",
    "text": "Literature Review\n\nBurnout\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) in their International Classification of Diseases, 11th Edition (ICD-11) describe burnout as “a syndrome conceptualized as resulting from chronic workplace stress that has not been successfully managed. It is characterised by three dimensions: 1) feelings of energy depletion or exhaustion; 2) increased mental distance from one’s job, or feelings of negativism or cynicism related to one’s job; and 3) a sense of ineffectiveness and lack of accomplishment” (World Health Organization, 2020). For several decades, burnout has been a preoccupation of librarians, the profession, and our professional literature. In fact, as Wood et al. (2020) demonstrate a scholarly literature search for burnout AND librar*, scholarly literature on burnout in librarians has had a steady upward trend for the past 4 decades. This has included considerable anecdotal evidence. In fact, over 30 years ago, Fisher (1990) called for further empirical evidence on burnout in librarians to answer her titular question “are librarians burning out?” While the extent of the anecdotal evidence should give us cause to believe librarians and a librarian’s belief that they are burnt out seems just as important as an empirical decision or diagnosis that they are, anecdotal approaches may leave us lacking as we attempt to understand the systemic and structural causes of burnout in libraries and mitigate these effects. Further quantitative and qualitative study of burnout among librarians will allow us to pinpoint solutions for library administration to make organization and structural changes for the benefit of library workers.\nEmploying the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory, Wood et al. (2020) found that librarian perceptions of burnout are quite high in comparison to other occupations, including nurses, hospital doctors, and social workers. This points to a significant issue that needs to be addressed. Considering job control as a component of agency may be one way to measure a specific aspect of burnout and mitigate feelings of workplace burnout. Applying the Areas of Worklife Survey (AWS) and Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), Nardine (2019) found “that lack of personal agency is the primary contributor to a sense of burnout (p. 508 ) However, the AWS doesn’t measure agency directly, but rather what Leiter & Maslach (2003) refer to as Control, which”includes employee’s perceived capacity to influence decisions that affect their work, to exercise professional autonomy, and to gain access to resources necessary to do an effective job” (p. 96).\n\n\nJob Control\nGanster (1989) defines control “as the ability to exert some influence over one’s environment so that the environment becomes more rewarding or less threatening.” Job control may have the following domains or dimensions hypothesized as “areas from which stress at work may arise”: work tasks, work pacing, work scheduling, physical environment, decision making, interaction, and mobility. He also points to a tradition of “employee participation in decision making” as an aspect of job control, which previous literature on burnout has pointed to as a solution [Sheesley (2001); Christian (2015); Maslach (2017); (Corrado, 2022)]. Maslach & Leiter (2016), identify job control, in relation to burnout and stress, as “the perceived capacity to influence decisions that affect their work, to exercise professional autonomy, and to gain access to the resources necessary to do an effective job.”\nLeiter & Maslach’s (2003) conception of control in the AWS used by (Nardine, 2019) relies on the Job Demand-Control (JDC) model (Karasek, 1979). The JDC model considers job demands (workload, pressure) and job control (sometimes decision latitude, a worker’s ability to control their work) and proposes that a high demands-low control job will result in greater physical and psychological stress, which suggests that increased job control can “buffer” the negative impacts of increased job demands (Van der Doef & Maes, 1999, p. 89). While it appears unlikely that this buffering hypothesis is true (Mansell & Brough, 2005), existing research supports the connection between low job control and increased burnout (Park et al., 2014; Portoghese et al., 2014; Taris et al., 2005).\n\n\nVocational Awe\nFobazi Ettarh (2018) describes vocational awe as “the set of ideas, values, and assumptions librarians have about themselves and the profession that result in beliefs that libraries as institutions are inherently good and sacred, and therefore beyond critique.” She argues that this positioning of the library as inherently good and thus of the workers in the library as the doers of that good work creates a situation in which any failure of the library is a failure of the individual “to live up to the ideals of the profession.” Ettarh argues, in particular, that burnout is one of several negative impacts caused by vocational awe. This sacredness of libraries becomes a way for institutions to deflect criticism and avoid caring for workers, pushing instead of individualized solutions to burnout that bely structural and systemic issues in library organizations and libraries broadly: “institutional response to burnout is the output of more ‘love and passion,’ through the vocational impulses noted earlier and a championing of techniques like mindfulness and ‘whole-person’ librarianship.” Martyrdom and self-sacrifice become features of the profession; these are necessary features to operate libraries that are understaffed and under-resourced—doing more with less: “Awe is easily weaponized against the worker, allowing anyone to deploy a vocational purity test in which the worker can be accuse of not being devout or passionate enough to serve without complaint.” Workers may even weaponize awe against themselves as a form of self-regulation to meet the unrealistic ideals of the profession."

    "text": "Materials and Methods\nA web survey was administered to measure job control and burnout among academic librarians with instruction responsibilities. To measure job control, the survey used the job control measure designed and validated by Dwyer & Ganster (1991), which includes 22 questions. To measure burnout, the survey used the Copenhagen Burnout inventory described by Kristensen, et al. (n.d.), which includes 19 questions.\n\nSample and Recruitment\nThe target population for the study was academic librarians with some instruction responsibilities. The survey was distributed using professional distribution lists provided by the ALA Connect platform that operates as a forum and email distribution system. The recruitment email was sent three times (29 August 2022, 13 September 2022, and 28 September 2022) with concurrent messages via the social media platform Twitter. To participate, individuals needed to be currently employed in an academic library and have at least some teaching responsibilities. Calculating the reach of these methods and who within that reach meets the participation requirement is difficult; however, the ALA Connect distribution was sent to three lists: ACRL Members, which includes approximately 7,200 members; ACRL Instruction Section, which includes 4,800 members; and Information Literacy Instruction in Academic Libraries, which includes 292 members. Given the size of the field and the connections between these groups, there is certainly overlap among the population across these three lists. In the end, 307 survey responses were collected, of which, 245 included complete results, which were used for data analysis. Demographic characteristics of the sample are included in Table 1. Participants could select more than one response for sexuality and race and ethnicity.\nTable 1.

The inventory includes 22 questions to measure job control across various dimensions. In Ganster (1989), the first 21 questions are used to measure job control, and question 22 is used as a control; however, in (Dwyer & Ganster, 1991), the authors use all 22 questions to calculate the job control score. Participants were asked all 22 questions; however, in this study, the first 21 questions are used to calculate the job control score. Participants were asked to complete this job control inventory as it applies to their job generally, and then asked again to complete the same job control inventory but thinking specifically about their instruction responsibilities or the instructional aspects of their roles. However, the questions were exactly the same both times. Despite the note about this in the survey, this may have resulted in fewer complete responses. Scoring for the job control inventory uses a Likert scale with values 1 through five attributed (Very little = 1; Little = 2; A moderate amount = 3; Much = 4; and Very much =5). The job control score is the average of these for the participant across the 21 items in the inventory.\nThe Chronbach’s alpha for the 21 item job control scale was 0.89 (n=245) when used for job control in general and 0.894 (n=245) when used for job control specifically related to instruction. Adding the twenty-second item increases the Chronbach’s alphas to 0.899 and 0.902 respectively; however, the internal consistency is still good with the 21-item scale, and the twenty-second item was meant as an overall control for perception. This is also similar to Ganster’s original 1989 report on the scale, which had an alpha of 0.87 (n = 191), and Dywer & Ganster (1991), which also had an alpha of 0.87 (n = 90).\nThe second of these validated scales was on burnout, using the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI), which includes three subscales: personal burnout (6 items), work-related burnout (7 items), and client-related burnout (6 items). For the purposes of this study, the word client in the client-related burnout subscale was changed to “patrons,” as it was believed that this terminology was better aligned with how librarians consider users. This is aligned with general usage of the CBI: “‘Clients’ is a broad concept covering terms such as patients, inmates, children, students, residents, etc. When the CBI is used in practice, the term appropriate for the specific group of respondents is used” (Kristensen et al., n.d.).\nKristensen et al. (n.d.) define these three dimensions measured by the subscales as follows:\n\nPersonal burnout: “the degree of physical and psychological fatigue and exhaustion experienced by the person”\nWork-related burnout: “the degree of physical and psychological fatigue and exhaustion that is perceived by the person as related to his/her work”\nClient-related burnout: “the degree of physical and psychological fatigue and exhaustion that is perceived by the person as related to his/her work with clients”\n\nThus, personal burnout is not necessarily related to an individual’s personal life but rather to a more general or generic assessment of burnout.\nThe CBI uses two different Likert scales that are given values ranging from 0 to 100, and one question in the work-related burnout inventory is inversely scored. The total work-related burnout score (TWRBS), total personal burnout score (TPBS), and total client-related burnout score (TCRBS) are the average within the given subscale for the participant.\nThe Chronbach’s alpha for the personal burnout subscale, work-related burnout subscale, and client-related burnout subscale from the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory were 0.875, 0.889, and 0.887 respectively, which is similar to Kristensen et al. (2005), which reported a range from 0.85 to 0.87 (n = 1,910), and Wood et al. (2020) with a Chronbach’s alpha of 0.798 (n = 1,808) for the work-related burnout subscale. The results demonstrate that these subscales have a good measure of reliability as well.\nFinally, the survey included questions about demographics and questions about the characteristics of the participants employment. The following demographic questions were included:\n\nWhat is your gender?\nWhat is your gender modality? “Gender modality refers to how a person’s gender identity stands in relation to their gender assigned at birth” (Ashley, 2022)\nWhat is your sexuality? Select all that apply.\nAre you disabled?\nWhich of the identities described above have you disclosed at work or would you consider to be “out” at work? Select all that apply.\nPlease describe your race/ethnicity. Select all that apply.\n\nA summary of this demographic information within the sample is available in Table 1 above.\nThe following questions about the characteristics of the participants employment were included because it was hypothesized that they would have an effect on job control or burnout:\n\nHow long (in years) have you worked at your current institution?\nHow long (in years) have you been in a librarian position after receiving your degree (in library science or equivalent)?\nHow long (in years) have you worked in libraries in any capacity?\nWhich of the following best describes the institution where you work?\nWhich of the following best describes your current position?\nWhat is your annual salary or income (before taxes, etc.) in US Dollars?\nWhich of the following best describes your employment status at your current institution?\nAre librarians at your institution eligible for tenure or an equivalent status?\nHave you obtained tenure or its equivalent at your institution? (This was only revealed if the participant answered yes to the previous question.)\nAre you represented by a union?\nHave you received formal training in library school or on the job specifically intended to prepare you to teach?\nDo you believe this training adequately prepared you for teaching? (This was only revealed if the participant answered yes to the previous question.)\nWhich of the following best describes your teaching workload?\n\nA summary of these characteristics within the sample is included in Table 2 below.\nTable 2.

Consent was implied by participants clicking a button labelled “I agree to participate” at the start of the survey after reading an information sheet concerning the study. No survey responses were required, so participants could simply skip any question; however, many questions also gave an option for “prefer not to disclose” as well."

Burnout is as persistent a topic in libraries as it is a concern for the people who work in them. Building on the scholarship and discussions around vocational awe, this panel will be equal parts research and advocacy. We will look at how and why burnout is manifesting in library staff so pervasively, as well as some ideas for changing our workplaces to mitigate, ameliorate, and prevent further harm.\n          \n        \n      \n      \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                            Burnout\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                            Librarian Worklife\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                            2023\n                        \n                    \n            \n            \n      \n      \n      \n    \n  \n    \n      Accessible access, universal design, and the limits of inclusion in open educational resource development: An interactive workshop\n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n        \n          2022.

But it is often difficult for instructors to anticipate the writing and information literacy skills their assignments require. To address this, UCLA librarians have partnered with writing faculty to create a course planner to help WAC instructors predict an assignment’s composition and research demands, and devise student-centered activities to address them. This session describes the collaboration that led to the planner and workshops conducted for WAC faculty and TAs, and gives participants opportunities to share similar ideas that are working on their campuses.\n          \n        \n      \n      \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                            Writing and Research\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                            Information Literacy\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                            2021\n                        \n                    \n            \n            \n      \n      \n      \n    \n  \n    \n      Conflicting interests and begrudging partnerships: Turning critical pedagogy on human resources\n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n        \n          2020.

Burnout is as persistent a topic in libraries as it is a concern for the people who work in them. Building on the scholarship and discussions around vocational awe, this panel will be equal parts research and advocacy. We will look at how and why burnout is manifesting in library staff so pervasively, as well as some ideas for changing our workplaces to mitigate, ameliorate, and prevent further harm.\n          \n        \n      \n      \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                            Burnout\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                            Librarian Worklife\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                            2023\n                        \n                    \n            \n            \n      \n      \n      \n    \n  \n    \n      Accessible access, universal design, and the limits of inclusion in open educational resource development: An interactive workshop\n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n        \n          2022.

But it is often difficult for instructors to anticipate the writing and information literacy skills their assignments require. To address this, UCLA librarians have partnered with writing faculty to create a course planner to help WAC instructors predict an assignment’s composition and research demands, and devise student-centered activities to address them.
