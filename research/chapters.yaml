  abstract: "In summer 2020, the authors collaborated on the fifth iteration of the Mellon Mays Undergraduate Fellowship (MMUF) Summer Writing and Research Train-ing Program (WRTP). The program is intended to support writing and research skills development for BIPOC, LGBTQIA, and disabled student researchers in-terested in pursuing careers in academia. Our chapter details the history of the program, elaborates on the extensive campus partnerships involved in its success, and provides reflections and best practices around program coordination, cultur-ally responsive pedagogy, student experience outside the classroom, and remote instruction to help others establish similar programs at their institutions. In par-ticular, we explore the necessary structures to create a sustainable and flexible program that has continued successfully for several years while also accounting for changing student needs, changes in personnel, historical events like protests and the pandemic, and a shift from offering the program in-person to online."

  abstract: "The connections between emotional labor and emotional exhaustion are underexplored in burnout literature. This is particularly troubling for service professions and feminized fields such as librarianship where invisible labor in the form of emotional labor is often an expected aspect of the job. To better consider affective and emotional labor, we explore these concepts and their application in library literature, and we discuss the ways that burnout is gendered and raced. We consider existing literature on burnout in academic libraries, assessment of burnout among academic librarians, and proposed solutions for burnout. We present several recommendations for approaching affect, burnout, and complicating capacity in order to more holistically understand and combat burnout."
