  abstract: "On March 10, 2020, UCLA announced a transition to remote teaching through the end of winter quarter. Remote teaching has been extended through all subsequent teaching periods through summer 2021. Similarly, remote work has remained a predominant work situation for the majority of UCLA Library staff, although some staff have returned to in-person work to support services that required on-site activity. A wider return to work will begin in July 2021. After this year and a half of remote teaching, UCLA is planning to return to primarily in-person instruction starting in fall 2021 in line with changes to Los Angeles County public health guidelines."

  abstract: "As consumer wearable health and mobile health technologies become embedded in everyday life, coalescing with the integration and use of personal health data and the personal health record in the sprawling domains of the medical-industrial complex (MIC), health/information literacy (H/IL) and data information literacy (DIL), become more important, both for users of these wearable devices and for undergraduate students who might be folded into the research process as participants or researchers.
            </br>
            The present paper argues for the integration of information literacy skills and instruction with a critical understanding of personal health data to provide useful skills for managing the massive amounts of personal health data that users are generating. My goal is to argue for an expansion of data information literacy to provide the necessary skills for users and researchers to critically assess their relationship to personal health data, understanding the concurrent modes of doing and undergoing surveillance."

  abstract: "Wuthering Heights presents two very different locations: Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange. Within the novel, these two locations are constantly at war, as are their inhabitants, forming two dueling camps. This paper looks at the locative characterizations developed by the Heights and the Grange in their inhabitants and the movements of the various characters of the novel."
