  abstract: "Providing library instruction, often via one-shots in someone else's classroom, may reduce feelings of agency or job control for academic instruction librarians. This study addresses potential differences in job control across core responsibilities, specifically looking at the difference between job duties overall and instruction responsibilities.</br></br>As we consider the characteristics of library instruction, we should consider how those characteristics impact librarian agency in teaching spaces and acts. For job control with regard to instruction, training and experience may have specific impacts and should be pursued as a means to empower academic library instructors."

  abstract: "Burnout is a pervasive problem in libraries; however, little empirical evidence exists to demonstrate burnout's extent and to assist in identifying evidence-based solutions. As far as quantitative analysis of burnout is concerned, the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) has been a primary tool for measuring burnout among human services workers. However, the tool is proprietary and can be cost-prohibitive for large samples or small/non-existent budgets. As we consider the measurement of burnout as a field, open tools are better aligned with the values of librarianship, and free tools are better aligned with the resources available for conducting research or internal assessments. The Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI) is a non-commercial, free, and easy-to-administer tool for measuring burnout across three dimensions: personal, work-related, and client-related. The CBI presents a cost-effective alternative to the MBI which may be particularly enticing for academic library leaders and researchers. This study assesses the psychometric properties, including factor structure and scale reliability, to contribute to demonstrating construct validity of the CBI among academic librarians in the United Studies using a probability sample stratified by institutional Carnegie classifications and geographic region.<br><br>Confirmatory Factory Analysis (CFA) is used the examine the factor structure and model fit of five models for the CBI: a correlated three factors model, a correlated two factors model (using work-related and client-related burnout), and three single factor models for each of the three independent subscales (personal, work-related, and client-related burnout). The factorial validity and model fit for the five models demonstrated in the study are reasonable, suggesting that the items in the three scales are successfully measuring the latent constructs (personal burnout, work-related burnout, and client-related burnout), which contributes to construct validity. The expected relationship between the observed variables (the items in the measurement model) and the latent constructs is supported by the CFA analyses. While other examinations of validity, including other aspects of construct validity, should also be examined, the findings support the use of the CBI for measurement of burnout among academic librarians."

  abstract: Job control encompasses a range of dimensions that reflect the extent to which employees have the freedom and discretion to make decisions about their work. Job control includes control over tasks, scheduling, work pacing, physical environment, decision-making, interaction, and mobility. A web survey was administered to academic librarians with instruction responsibilities. The survey included a previously developed scale for measuring job control and several key demographic and job characteristic questions that were hypothesized to impact job control. 307 academic instruction librarians completed the job control scale. Analyzing each item in the job control scale, teaching workload, status, income, years at institution and in libraries, teacher training, union representation, and tenure status have statistically significant effects on responses to at least one question in the scale. Through analysis of the average response among academic instruction librarians in the sample, control over decision-making, including allocation of resources and salaries, and interactions appear to be two places where managers and library leaders may focus improvements. Control over the amount of money academic instruction librarians earn and over how their work is evaluated were the lowest across the 22 items in the job control scale. As library leaders and managers consider the practical implications of job control research on their work, earnings, evaluation processes, and interactions or interruptions may be key areas to enact changes or provide further transparency and shared decision-making.

  abstract: <b>Introduction:</b> The impacts of open educational resources (OER) are both well-documented and far-reaching. Without mitigating the positive outcomes of OER—including reduced textbook costs, readily available knowledge platforms, and open research—we problematize the commonly held assumption that open resources are necessarily more accessible and inherently good.</br></br><b>Description of Program:</b> Drawing on writing from antiracist, feminist disability researchers and advocates, we critically examine the UCLA Library online open educational initiative known as Writing Instruction + Research Education (WI+RE). In doing so, we (1) demonstrate how open access (OA) is often framed as an end, when in fact it is just the beginning; (2) encourage readers to resist evangelizing the OA movement such that it is beyond critique; and (3) advocate for the centering of disability justice within and beyond our OA efforts.</br></br><b>Next Steps:</b> We discuss both general and specific approaches for centering accessibility in creative processes, advocate for expanded definitions of OERs (beyond simply being “free”), and caution against evangelizing OERs without acknowledging the structural factors that contribute to inaccessibility. We outline four strategies and recommendations for other practitioners, educators, and designers seeking to build accessibility and dis-ability justice into OER design and OA initiatives more broadly. We approach OER both practically and theoretically to present an argument and path forward for designing more accessible resources and expanding OA through accessible access and universal design.

  abstract: Librarians have been grappling with the issue of burnout for decades, at least. This study uses the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI) and Job Control Inventory to show how job control impacts burnout. Using the CBI, academic instruction librarians, on average, have high work-related burnout and even higher personal burnout compared to other jobs. However, librarians have low client-related burnout, similar to other “caring” or “helping” professions. The findings point to key factors that impact job control and burnout to help consider ways of mitigating burnout and increasing job control.

  abstract: Purpose</br>Prior to 2020, University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Library's research services spanned multiple service points. Multiple locations were staffed by Library Student Research Assistants (LSRAs) and each location was supervised independently. While efforts to increase collaboration had been underway, much of the work and services remained siloed and often duplicated training and service hours.</br></br>Design/methodology/approach</br>With the onset of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), UCLA Library rapidly transitioned from entirely in-person to entirely online services. With multiple service points pivoting, UCLA was redundant to have multiple online desks providing Zoom appointments and that quickly became apparent. Moreover, transitioning in-person student work to remote work was paramount to providing both normal services to users and allowing LSRAs to keep jobs during a time of uncertainty and insecurity.</br></br>Findings</br>While the authors' original consolidation of services and implementation of shared supervision was a result of the pandemic and primarily involved online services, the authors have maintained this shared approach and collaborative vision in returning to in-person services. For the past year, the authors have offered shared in-person (at two library locations) and online services. As subject-specific library locations begin to reopen their desks, the authors continue to identify ways to leverage shared supervision and a robust referral model for those on-site services while negotiating student staffing and the need for both general and subject-specific services.</br></br>Originality/value</br>The authors present a novel approach to peer-to-peer teaching and learning and research services and shared student worker supervision with services coordinated across multiple locations and disciplines within a large academic library serving a large student population.

  abstract: For over a decade, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) has offered some variation of the Community Workshop Series (CWS), a partnership to provide digital literacy and computer technology classes to community members at local public libraries. Both authors have served as coordinators of the program as library science graduate students at the UNC School of Information and Library Science. We situate this program within existing literature on digital and information literacy, community engagement, and the graduate student experience to show the utility of this program and similar programs for training graduate students, enhancing the graduate student experience, supporting the needs of community members, and bolstering the capacities of public libraries. The authors provide an overview of the program and encourage others to start similar programs. To this end, the authors present a case study of the CWS, including discussion of creating the program and keeping things going, and provide a how-to guide for creating your own. The authors identify four recommendations for creating a similar program to clearly delineate takeaways that might inform readers’ attempts to create similar programs, and they provide additional materials and documentation in appendices to support the creation of new community-engaged programs in LIS.

  abstract: "This article presents case studies for the use of TimelineJS in two types of courses: sophomore-level humanities survey courses at the University of North Texas (UNT), and senior capstone history seminars at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), both large land-grant research institutions. The case studies offer a framework for assignment scaffolding (including iteration and reflection), FERPA rights management, and describe models of faculty-librarian collaboration in assignment design and implementation. These assignments provide students an introduction to basic metadata and HTML markup skills and empower them to explore the historical contexts of primary sources by visualizing the chronology of historical periods."
