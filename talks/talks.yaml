  description: "In a panel discussion led by Lynn Hoffman (Deputy Director, Somerset County Library System of New Jersey), Matthew Weirick Johnson (Director of Research & Instruction, University of South Florida) and Jessica Jones (Library Director, Takoma Park Maryland Library) will discuss burnout in libraries as researched and witnessed in both academic and public institutions. Burnout is as persistent a topic in libraries as it is a concern for the people who work in them. Building on the scholarship and discussions around vocational awe, this panel will be equal parts research and advocacy. We will look at how and why burnout is manifesting in library staff so pervasively, as well as some ideas for changing our workplaces to mitigate, ameliorate, and prevent further harm."

  description: "Writing across the curriculum (WAC) courses involve assignments in which writing and research are deeply intertwined. But it is often difficult for instructors to anticipate the writing and information literacy skills their assignments require. To address this, UCLA librarians have partnered with writing faculty to create a course planner to help WAC instructors predict an assignment’s composition and research demands, and devise student-centered activities to address them. This session describes the collaboration that led to the planner and workshops conducted for WAC faculty and TAs, and gives participants opportunities to share similar ideas that are working on their campuses."
