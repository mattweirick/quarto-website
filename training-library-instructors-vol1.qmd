title: "Training Library Instructors, Vol. 1: A Guide to Training Graduate Students"
description: "Pedagogy impacts all parts of library work and culture. It changes the way we interact with learners regardless of setting and however we name or define the teaching moment, from research help to outreach to leading meetings. Pedagogy is a praxis of relation, and studying it can improve all aspects of our work and organizations.</br></br>In two volumes, <i>Training Library Instructors</i> collects examples of how we train our colleagues to teach, whether they’re student workers, non-librarian staff, new or experienced librarians, or something else entirely. Volume 1, <i>A Guide to Training Graduate Students</i>, focuses on teacher training for graduate students in LIS programs and in academic libraries. It presents existing literature and theories, approaches to teaching library school students to teach, and critical reflections from librarians about their varied experiences receiving teacher training.</br></br><i>A Guide to Training Graduate Students</i> provides a useful introduction, detailed examples, and salient reflections to help us better train library instructors during their time as graduate students through coursework and work experience. You’ll discover ideas for designing courses, internships, and other programs and ways to mentor graduate students who are interested in becoming library instructors."
