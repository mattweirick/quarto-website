title: "Training Library Instructors, Vol. 2: A Guide to Training Librarians"
description: "Pedagogy impacts all parts of library work and culture. It changes the way we interact with learners regardless of setting and however we name or define the teaching moment, from research help to outreach to leading meetings. Pedagogy is a praxis of relation, and studying it can improve all aspects of our work and organizations.</br></br>In two volumes, <i>Training Library Instructors</i> collects examples of how we train our colleagues to teach, whether theyâ€™re student workers, non-librarian staff, new or experienced librarians, or something else entirely. In Volume 2, <i>A Guide to Training Librarians</i>, librarians share their knowledge about teaching, learning, and pedagogy through a variety of replicable activities: formal and informal workshops, courses, communities of practice, peer observation, and more. Programs include mock instruction, nano-teaching, and other feedback and homework mechanisms; happen at the individual, institutional, or consortial level; and can involve collaborations across library or university departments.</br></br>So many librarians value lifelong learning and the opportunity to learn from each other. <i>A Guide to Training Librarians</i> provides a starting point for readers considering their own teach-the-teacher programs and various approaches to learning together, exploring library instruction for the first time, or expanding existing knowledge through continued education."
